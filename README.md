# 📊 Digital Marketing ML: Customer Prediction & Segmentation

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze a digital marketing campaign dataset. It consists of two main tasks:  
1. **Customer Conversion Prediction**: Predict whether a customer will convert using classification models.  
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Cluster customers based on demographic and behavioral features.  

## 🚀 Project Workflow
### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze customer demographics, engagement metrics, and campaign effectiveness.  
- Visualize patterns and correlations.  

### 2️⃣ Customer Conversion Prediction  
- Train models to predict conversion probability using features like engagement, income, and past behavior.  
- Models used:  
  ✅ Decision Tree  
  ✅ Random Forest  
  ✅ XGBoost  
  ✅ LightGBM  

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation (Clustering)  
- Segment customers based on income, age, loyalty score, and other relevant factors.  
- Algorithms used:  
  ✅ K-Means  
  ✅ Hierarchical Clustering  
  ✅ DBSCAN  

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, K-Means)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (For step-by-step analysis)
